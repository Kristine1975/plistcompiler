PList Compiler
==============

PList Compiler is a property list compiler for XCode, 
Apple's development environment. It lets you build localized and
non-localized plist files from plc and ploc source files.
This is version 0.2.

PList Compiler is a script that you execute as a 
Shell Script Build Phase within your XCode project and which takes
care of generating automatically the property list files for your packaged
applications, bundles, frameworks, plugins, etc.

For the curious, PList Compiler is written in fact in Tcl 
(the Tool Command Language <http://wiki.tcl.tk/>): 
the executable script is a bash script called plcompile
which magically redirects the instructions to tclsh which is the
Tcl shell. Tcl is installed by default on OSX since version 10.3 (aka
Panther) so tclsh is normally present on every MacOSX system
starting from this version, and there should be nothing special to do for
this script to run there.

The 0.2 release of PList Compiler is a fully
functional release. It has been thoroughly tested but there is certainly
room left for improvements.  Thank you for sending feedback.

A help file with complete documentation about the PLC syntax and
instructions about the usage of the compiler in an XCode project is
included in the distribution. You can also
read it online. <http://webperso.easyconnect.fr/bdesgraupes/DocHTML/PListCompilerHelp.html>
