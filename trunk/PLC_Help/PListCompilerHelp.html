<H2><A NAME="M1"></A>Introduction</H2><P><B>PList Compiler</B> is a property list compiler for XCode. It lets you build
localized and non-localized plist files from plc and ploc source files. <P>It is modelled on the CodeWarrior property list language: the idea of
preparing source files and compiling them during the build process was
introduced in CodeWarrior Pro 8. The language used in these source files
lets you have the compiler build the property list files for you
automatically, substituting the right values during the building process,
instead of having to manage manually hard-coded XML files. CodeWarrior Pro 
8 introduced a first draft of the plc language together with a dedicated 
compiler written by Josef W. Wankerl. Unfortunately XCode does not offer 
such a handy tool. Here comes <B>PList Compiler</B>!<P>It is a shell script, named <B>plcompile</B>, which is meant to be executed during a Shell Script
Build Phase within an XCode project. It can also be run independently as a
command line tool.<P><B>PList Compiler</B> uses the same syntax as the original CodeWarrior 
compiler, supports most of its functionalities and adds many more to take 
advantage of all the XCode settings.<P><B>PList Compiler</B> is written in fact in Tcl 
(the <A HREF="http://wiki.tcl.tk/"> Tool Command Language</A>): 
the executable script is a <I>bash</I> script which magically redirects the
instructions to <I>tclsh</I> which is the Tcl shell. Tcl is installed by
default on OSX since version 10.3 (aka Panther) so <I>tclsh</I> is
normally present on every MacOSX system starting from this version, so 
there should be nothing special to do for this script to run there. For
version 10.2 systems (aka Jaguar), you will have to install Tcl on your
machine: you can for instance get Daniel Steffen's Tcl Batteries Included distribution 
<A HREF="http://www.maths.mq.edu.au/~steffen/tcltk/"> from there.</A><P><B>PList Compiler</B> comes with the same BSD license as Tcl itself. 
See the file <I>License_terms</I> included in this distribution or the 
<A HREF="http://www.opensource.org/licenses/bsd-license"> Open Source Initiative (OSI) site</A>.<P><H2><A NAME="M2"></A>Usage</H2><P>The syntax of the plcompile shell script is:
<PRE>
    plcompile options plcFile
    plcompile -help
</PRE><P>The second form
<PRE>
    plcompile -help
</PRE>
prints the usage together with some default values in the Terminal window.<P>The first form executes the compilation of the plc source file <I>plcFile</I>. 
Traditionnally these files have a <I>.plc</I> extension but this is not 
required at all. Most of the time you will not have to worry about the 
options. <B>PList Compiler</B> comes with reasonable defaults for the 
optional values, corresponding to a normal usage of these files in a 
project. The available options are explained below.<P><H3><A NAME="M3"></A>Default behavior</H3><P><H3><A NAME="M4"></A>Command line options</H3><P>The complete syntax of the compiler is:
<PRE>
    plcompile [-input_encoding <enc>] [-output_encoding <enc>] [-input_eol <eol>] 
                            [-output_eol <eol>] [-dest folder] [-plist <version>] plcFile
</PRE><P>The options have the following meaning:
<UL>
	<LI> the -input_encoding option lets you specify in which encoding the 
source file should be read;
	<LI> the -output_encoding option  lets you specify in which encoding the 
output files should be written (usually utf-8);
	<LI> the -input_eol option lets you specify the type of line endings used in the
source file (cr for Mac, lf for Unix and crlf for Windows);
	<LI> the -output_eol option lets you specify the type of line endings used in
the source files;
	<LI> the -dest option lets you specify a destination folder relatively to which
the output files will be produced. The usual default location is the 
Contents folder inside the application bundle when you are building a packaged 
application. See also below various pragmas which can additionnally specify 
different subfolders inside the destination folder.
	<LI> the -plist option lets you specify the version of the plist XML format (0.9 
or 1.0). The default value is 1.0.
</UL><P><H2><A NAME="M5"></A>Howto</H2><P><H3><A NAME="M6"></A>Using PList Compiler in an XCode project</H3><P>The idea is to generate the various plist files and localized strings
files during a <I>Shell Script Build Phase</I> within your XCode project. 
XCode lets you define <I>Shell Script Build Phases</I>: they are shell
scripts which can be executed at any stage of the building process. <P>So, in order to use <B>PList Compiler</B>, you would normally create, in
all the targets for which you want plist files to be generated, a build phase
which could take place at the end of the build process. To create a 
<I>Shell Script Build Phase</I>, select the target you want in the <I>Groups
and Files</I> panel of your main project window and select the <I>Shell
Script Build Phase</I> command in the <I>New Build Phase</I> submenu of
the <I>Project</I> menu. If you open the disclosure triangle located in 
fornt of your target's name, you will see your shell phase (in XCode 2.1, 
it is called <I>Run Script</I>). Select it and click on the Info button 
in the toolbar (or select <I>Get Info</I> in the <I>File</I> menu).<P>XCode displays a window in which you can enter shell commands to execute. 
If your plc file is named MyApp.plc, you should just have to enter a 
command like
<PRE>
    plcompile /path/to/MyApp.plc
</PRE>
The only point is to make sure that the shell (Bash shell) can find the 
<B>plcompile</B> script. This depends on where you have put this sscript on your 
machine. If it is in one of the oflders of your shell <TT>PATH</TT> variable there 
should be no problem. Otherwise you can specify the complete path of the 
script, like for instance:
<PRE>
        /Users/bernardo/Devel/Tools/plcompile /path/to/MyApp.plc
</PRE>
or alternatively change the directory to this directory and execute the 
script there, like this:
<PRE>
        cd /Users/bernardo/Devel/Tools
        ./plcompile /path/to/MyApp.plc
</PRE>
supposing that <B>plcompile</B> resides in /Users/bernardo/Devel/Tools.<P><H3><A NAME="M7"></A>Using PList Compiler in Terminal</H3><P>The <I>plcompile</I> script can be used directly from the command line (in
a Terminal window). There is only one caveat with this approach: only the
environment variables defined in the current shell window are available.
This means that you must make sure, if ever your plc file makes use of
environment variables defined by XCode, that they are available in the
shell. You could have to define them manually. If your plc file does not
need any of the values set by XCode, then you should normally be able to
compile your plc files directly. You will probably want, in that case, to
specify a destination folder using the <I>-dest</I> command line option.<P>For instance:
<PRE>
    /Developer/Tools/plcompile -dest ~/Devel/Tests myfile.plc
</PRE><P><H3><A NAME="M8"></A>Troubleshooting</H3><P>Make sure that the plcompile script has been saved with Unix line endings
(lf) rather than Mac line endings (cr). Some editors tend to change them 
in your back.<P>Make sure there is not an already existing Info.plist file in your source 
files added to your built product during the <I>Copy Bundle Resources</I> 
phase. <P>Also make sure, in the target settings, that no file has been declared in 
the <I>Info.plist File</I> setting (in the Packaging section of the 
General settings).<P>If the script is not found by the shell, read the informations in the 
section above about executing shell phases in XCode.<P><H2><A NAME="M9"></A>Anatomy of 'plc' files</H2><P>The .plc source files are regular text files taken as input by the PList 
Compiler in order to produce one or several output files. They contains 
three types of commands:
<UL>
	<LI> preprocessor macros, simlar to those found in C or C++ source files
	<LI> specific commands understood and interpreted by the compiler
	<LI> lines starting with a double slash (//) are comments: they are ignored by 
the processor
</UL><P><H3><A NAME="M10"></A>The plc commands</H3><P>Most of these commands correspond to an XML entity in the output Info.plist
file. An Info.plist file is an XML document. The format of the plist files
is specified by Apple in a DTD which can be found in 
<I>/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList.dtd</I>.
For a detailed description of property lists files, see for instance
<A HREF="http://developer.apple.com/documentation/CoreFoundation/Conceptual/CFPropertyLists/index.html"> Introduction to Property Lists</A><P>All the commands must be kept on a separate line (not necessarily at the 
beginning of the line).<P><H4><A NAME="M11"></A>The 'plist' command</H4><P>The first command found in a .plc file designed to generate a .plist file
is always the <I>plist</I> command. Its argument is a block enclosed
inside a pair of curly braces. A minimal property list file,
describing a completely empty property list, would look like this:
<PRE>
    plist {}
</PRE><P>The <I>plist</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>plist<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P><H4><A NAME="M12"></A>The 'dictionary' command</H4><P>Directly inside the <I>plist</I> block, there is usually a <I>dictionary</I> 
command. This is not required by the DTD but all property lists in use are
structured like this. Like with <I>plist</I> command, the argument of a
<I>dictionary</I> command is a block enclosed inside a pair of curly
braces. So, a minimal valid plc source file would be:
<PRE>
    plist
    {
        dictionary {}
    }
</PRE><P>The <I>plist</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>dict<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P>The dictionary is made up of key/value pairs. The key names must be unique within a single
dictionary. The value of a key can have any of the following types: array, boolean,
data, date, dictionary, number, or string.<P><H4><A NAME="M13"></A>The 'key' command</H4><P>The key/value pairs are expressed by instructions with the following format
<PRE>
    key "name_of_the_key" value "type_of_value" "the_value"
</PRE><P>In this instruction the <I>key</I> and  <I>value</I> keywords correspond
to the <TT>&lt;</TT>key<TT>&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;</TT>value<TT>&gt;</TT>  XML tags.<P>For instance, here is a valid key statement to put in a dictionary block:
<PRE>
    key "Victor Hugo" value string "Writer"
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M14"></A>The 'array' command</H4><P>The <I>array</I> command is used to describe an ordered list of property list elements.
These elements can be of any of the types already mentioned (array, boolean,
data, date, dictionary, number, or string).<P>The original specification of the plc syntax in CodeWarrior stipulated that
the argument of an <I>array</I> command is a block enclosed inside a pair
of square brackets. With <B>PList Compiler</B>, you can also use curly braces
instead of square brackets.<P>Here is an example of an array containing a dictionary and a boolean value:
<PRE>
    array
    {
        boolean true
        dictionary {
            key "Victor Hugo" value string "Writer"
            key "Ludwig van Beethoven" value string "Composer"
        }
    }
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M15"></A>The 'string' command</H4><P>The <I>string</I> command lets you specify a string value. Strings are enclosed
between double quotes in order to distinguish them from a substitutable
variable (see below), but this is not required. If there is no risk of
ambiguity, you can suppress the double quotes, but it still is good
programming practice to write them.<P>The value of a string can be made up of several pieces, mixing quoted strings or 
variables. For instance:
<PRE>
    string "copyright (c) " __YEAR__ ", all rights reserved" 
</PRE><P>where __YEAR__ is one of the predefined variables set by the compiler.
The <I>string</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>string<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P><H4><A NAME="M16"></A>The 'number' command</H4><P>The <I>number</I> command lets you specify numeric values. There is no 
XML tag named <I>number</I> in a plist file, but rather two entities named 
<TT>&lt;</TT>real<TT>&gt;</TT> and <TT>&lt;</TT>integer<TT>&gt;</TT> corresponding 
respectively to integer or floating point values. The <I>number</I> 
command corresponds to both of them: the compiler automatically decides to 
which type the value belongs. For instance, the following declarations will 
result in an <TT>&lt;</TT>integer<TT>&gt;</TT> tag:
<PRE>
    number 0
    number 1
    number -1
</PRE>
while the following ones will yield <TT>&lt;</TT>real<TT>&gt;</TT> tags:
<PRE>
    number 0.0
    number 3.14
    number -2.718
    number .1
    number -.1
    number 6.09e23
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M17"></A>The 'date' command</H4><P>The <I>date</I> command lets you specify a date value. The plist format 
specification (in PropertyList.dtd) suggests that 
<BLOCKQUOTE><P><I> the 
contents of a date value should conform to a subset of ISO 8601:
in particular, YYYY '-' MM '-' DD 'T' HH ':' MM ':' SS 'Z'. 
Smaller units may be omitted with a loss of precision.
</I></P></BLOCKQUOTE><P>For instance:
<PRE>
    date "2005-09-15 18:06:03"
    date "2005-09-15T18:06:03Z"
    date __DATE__
</PRE>
where __DATE__ is one of the predefined variables set by the compiler.
The <I>date</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>date<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P><H4><A NAME="M18"></A>The 'data' command</H4><P>The <I>data</I> command is used to store raw binary data. The value of a
data type is expressed in the plc file in hexadecimal format, possibly with
space characters, like for instance:
<PRE>
    data "64656667"
    data "64 65 66 67"
    data "64 65"  "66 67"
</PRE>
In the output file, the same data is represented in Base64 encoding as 
mentioned in the DTD specifying the plist format (/System/Library/DTDs/PropertyList.dtd).<P>The <I>data</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>data<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P><B>Note:</B> the CodeWarrior plist compiler also defined a <I>data file</I> command followed by the name of a file containing raw data. This is not
implemented by <B>PList Compiler</B> as of version 0.1.<P><H4><A NAME="M19"></A>The 'boolean' command</H4><P>The <I>boolean</I> command lets you specify a boolean value using any of
the usual keywords: true/false, yes/no, and 1/0. Casing does not matter, so
TRUE, true or True are all acceptable values. The value can be enclosed in
double quotes but this is not required.<P>For example:
<PRE>
    key "kGcc_Precompile_Prefix_Header" value boolean 1
    key "kGcc_Symbols_Private_Extern" value boolean 0
    key "kGenerate_Profiling_Code" value boolean Yes
    key "kUse_Dynamic_No_Pic" value boolean "false"
    key "kZero_Link" value string __ZERO_LINK__
</PRE><P>The last example is correct because XCode defines a ZERO_LINK variable 
whose value can be either "YES" or "NO" (see below).<P>The <I>boolean</I> command corresponds to the <TT>&lt;</TT>boolean<TT>&gt;</TT> XML tag.<P><H3><A NAME="M20"></A>Localized files</H3><P><H4><A NAME="M21"></A>The 'localize' command</H4><P>The <I>localize</I> command is used to create localized strings files. It is a 
top level command like the <I>plist</I> command. There are two possible 
syntaxes to invoke this command:
<PRE>
    localize "language"
    localize "language" as "localized_file_name"
</PRE><P>The first form is used to localize string values present in the main property list
dictionary of the <I>plist</I> command. The resulting file is named by 
default
<I>InfoPlist.strings</I> instead of Info.plist, and is located inside the 
localized folder corresponding to the specified language instead of the 
<I>Contents</I> folder. For instance:
<PRE>
    /Contents/Resources/Spanish.lproj/InfoPlist.strings
</PRE><P>The second form of the localize command specifies the name of the generated
file rather than relying on the default name. This allows to create as many
separate strings files as necessary. These files will also be created in
the folder corresponding to the specified language.<P>The argument of the <I>localize</I> command is a block enclosed in a pair of 
curly braces. Only two commands can be used inside a localize block: key 
and comment. The key command defines key/value statements of string type. <P>For instance:
<PRE>
    localize "French"
    {
        key "CFBundleGetInfoString" value string "MyApp, (c) 2005, tous droits réservés"
        key "CFBundleHelpBookName" value string "Aide Rezilla"
    }
    
    localize "Spanish" as "Dialogs.strings"
    {
        key "Number of Recent Items:" value string "Número de ítems recientes:"
        key "General Preference Pane" value string "Panel de preferencias General"
    }
</PRE>
The first instruction generates 
<I>MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/French.lproj/InfoPlist.strings</I>
and the scond one
<I>MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/Spanish.lproj/Dialogs.strings</I><P>It is current practice to put the <I>localize</I> blocks in separate files and 
use a <I>.ploc</I> extension in their name to distinguish them from the <I>.plc</I> 
files. The <I>.ploc</I> files are usually invoked from the main .plc file with an 
<TT>#include</TT> preprocessor command.<P><H4><A NAME="M22"></A>The 'comment' command</H4><P>The <I>comment</I> command lets you insert comments inside the localized
strings files. There can be as many commands of this type in a <I>localize</I> block as necessary. The value of the command is a string or
concatenation of strings and expandable variables: once concatenated and
substituted, it is inserted inside a C/C++ like comment of the form 
<TT>/* */</TT> in the output file.
For instance, the following instruction might be found in some <I>.ploc</I> file:
<PRE>
    localize "English" as "Dialogs.strings"
    {
        comment "Generated from " __FILE__ " at " __TIME__
    }
</PRE><P>The <TT>__FILE__</TT> and the <TT>__TIME__</TT> symbols are predefined variables: <TT>__FILE__</TT> 
always contains the name of the file being currently processed by the 
compiler and <TT>__TIME__</TT> the time at the moment the compiler processes the 
file. If the instruction above was stored in a file named 
<I>dialogStrings_EN.ploc</I>, the comment generated in the resulting <I>Dialogs.strings</I> file (inside in the /Contents/Resources/English.lproj 
folder inside the bundle) would look like this:
/* Generated from dialogStrings_EN.ploc at 23:54:25 */<P><B>Caveat:</B> the <I>comment</I> command can't be used in a <I>plist</I> block.<P><H2><A NAME="M23"></A>Location of the output files</H2><P>By default the <I>plist</I> command causes <B>PList Compiler</B> to
create a file named Info.plist inside the destination directory. In the
case of a packaged application, the default destination directory is the
<I>Contents</I> folder inside the bundle. More generally, the path of this
destination folder is built by <B>PList Compiler</B> using the values of
the <TT>BUILT_PRODUCTS_DIR</TT> and <TT>CONTENTS_FOLDER_PATH</TT> XCode
variables. <P>For instance, with XCode 2.1, if your target is in the <I>Release</I>
configuration and your application is MyApp, the destination folder would
be (unless you have non standard settings):
<PRE>
    $SRCROOT/build/Release/MyApp.app/Contents 
</PRE>
where SRCROOT is, as usual the folder containing your project file.<P>By default, the <I>localize</I> command causes <B>PList Compiler</B> to
create localized files. The default location for these files depends on the
language used for the localization. In the case of a packaged application,
the default destination is inside one of the /Contents/Resources/&lt;language&gt;.lproj
subfolders of the bundle. For instance /Contents/Resources/English.lproj or
/Contents/Resources/French.lproj.<P>There are two ways of modifying the destination folders:
<UL>
	<LI> from the command line, using the -dest option
	<LI> using one of the in_package_directory or localize_directory pragmas (see below)
</UL><P>The output file name (usually Info.plist) can be modified using the
<I>output_filename</I> pragma. See the <I>Pragmas</I> section below.<P><H2><A NAME="M24"></A>Preprocessor directives</H2><P>This is the other type of instruction. They are called preprocessor directives 
by analogie with the C/C++ language.
They are also sometimes refered to as preprocessor macros. The 
preprocessor term is not quite accurate here 
because there are not two phases like with the ordinary C compilers (a 
preprocessing phase and a compiling phase). <B>PList Compiler</B> pases 
the file once, line by line.<P>The following macros are supported by <B>PList Compiler</B>:
<P><TABLE BORDER=0 CELLPADDING=1>
<TR><TD>#define</TD><TD>#if</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>#include</TD><TD>#ifdef</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>#pragma</TD><TD>#ifndef</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>#message</TD><TD>#elif</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>#warning</TD><TD>#else</TD></TR>
<TR><TD>#error</TD><TD>#endif</TD></TR>
</TABLE></P><P>Preprocessor directives all occur on their own line. They are characterized
by the fact that the first non-whitespace character on the line is a #. 
There may be whitespace characters between the # mark and the name of the 
directive too.<P><H3><A NAME="M25"></A>Defines</H3>
The <I>#define</I> directive lets you define a macro in the property list compiler.  The
format is:
<PRE>
    #define macro_name macro_text
</PRE><P>The compiler adds the macro <I>macro_name</I> to its macro table: if 
there is already a macro with this name, it emits an error. When <I>macro_name</I>
appears in a plc source file as the value of a string type not 
enclosed between double quotes, it will be replaced with
<I>macro_text</I>.<P>For instance, if a macro <I>kVersionNumber</I> is defined like this:
<PRE>
    #define kVersionNumber "1.2.3"
</PRE>
then, when the compiler encounters the following instruction:
<PRE>
    key "CFBundleShortVersionString" value string "kVersionNumber: " kVersionNumber
</PRE>
it expands it to <I>kVersionNumber: 1.2.3</I><P>The <I>#undef</I> directive tells the compiler to remove an already 
existing macro from its macro table. The syntax is:
<PRE>
    #undef macro_name
</PRE>
If <I>macro_name</I> does not exist, the directive is just ignored.<P><H3><A NAME="M26"></A>Includes</H3>
The <I>#include</I> directive tells the plist compiler to find another 
plc source
file and start processing it. The format of this directive is:
<PRE>
    #include "filename"
</PRE><P>The <I>filename</I> value designates a file to include: it can be either 
an absolute or a relative path. A relative path is resolved relatively to the folder 
containing the plc source file itself. The following are all valid 
examples:
<PRE>
    #include /Users/bernardo/Devel/MyApp/Rsrc/MyApp.plc
    #include MyApp.plc
    #include LocFiles/MyStrings_EN.ploc
    #include ../Rsrc/MyStrings_EN.ploc
</PRE><P><B>Note:</B> the CodeWarrior property list compiler also accepts filenames 
enclosed in angle brackets to designate files located in the system access 
paths. This is not currently supported by <B>PList Compiler</B> as of version 0.1.<P><H3><A NAME="M27"></A>Conditional macros</H3><P><H3><A NAME="M28"></A>Errors and warnings</H3><P>The <I>#error</I> directive raises an error and stops the execution of the
compiler. This is generally used in combination with <I>#if</I> directives
to test for situations that should never occur.<P>The <I>#warning</I> directive emits a message in the console.
The <I>#message</I> directive is just a synonym for <I>#warning</I>.<P><H3><A NAME="M29"></A>Pragmas</H3><P>Pragmas are directives used to modify the internal state of the compiler. 
They let you modify some internal settings during the execution of the plc 
file. They are most useful to modify locally a global setting: the new 
value set by a pragma holds until another pragma modifies it again. 
A pragma is declared with the <I>#pragma</I> directive. The syntax is:
<PRE>
    #pragma pragma_name [pragma_value]
</PRE><P>The supported pragmas are explained below. The <I>pragma_name</I> argument
can be one of the following keywords:
<I>output_filename,
in_package_directory,
localize_directory,
output_eol,
output_encoding,
plist_version.</I><P>Any other pragma encountered will be simply ignored by <B>PList Compiler</B>. In particular the <I>once</I>, <I>notonce</I>, and <I>mark</I>
pragmas which exist in the CodeWarrior compiler are not supported, as of
version 0.1.<P><B>Caution:</B> a pragma cannot be used inside a <I>plist</I> or a 
<I>localize</I> block. It must be invoked outside these environments. This
is because the internal settings they affect can't be modified once a file
has been opened for output. The compiler will emit an error if such a 
situation occurs.<P><H4><A NAME="M30"></A>The 'output_filename' pragma</H4>
The <I>output_filename</I> pragma lets you override the default name 
of the current output file. Its value is a string which is the new name. 
For instance:
<PRE>
    #pragma output_filename "OtherName.plist"
</PRE><P>The new name given with this pragma is used only once and immediately 
forgotten so that the compiler returns to the default naming convention. 
Note that this does not affect the filename defined in a  'localize as' 
command. More precisely, if the compiler reads the following inxtructions:
<PRE>
    #pragma output_filename "OtherName.txt"
    localize "Spanish" as "Error.strings"
    {
    }
</PRE>
the pragma will have no effect and the output file will still be named 
<I>Error.strings</I>. On the other hand, the pragma will remain in effect 
until it can be applied. <P><H4><A NAME="M31"></A>The 'in_package_directory' pragma</H4>
The <I>in_package_directory</I> pragma lets you specify where to place the
property list file inside the destination folder. It is a string which
specifies a directory relative to the destination folder. For instance, if
you write:
<PRE>
    #pragma in_package_directory "Infos"
</PRE>
the <I>Info.plist</I> file will be written in an <I>Infos</I> subfolder
of the destination folder rather than in the destination folder directly.
If the subfolder does not exist, it is created. By default, this will be
<I>MyApp.app/Contents/Infos</I> (unless another destination folder has 
been specified).<P>Another valid value for this pragma could be:
<PRE>
	#pragma in_package_directory "../Infos/Properties"
</PRE>
which would write the output file in <I>MyApp.app/Infos/Properties</I>,
i-e with the <I>Infos</I> directory at the same level as the 
<I>Contents</I> directory.<P><H4><A NAME="M32"></A>The 'localize_directory' pragma</H4>
While the previous pragma affected the final location of the <I>Info.plist</I>
files (produced by the <I>plist</I> command), the <I>localize_directory</I>
pragma lets you specify where to place the localized string files produced
by the <I>localize</I> command. It is a string which specifies a directory
relative to the destination folder. By default, it is the <I>Resources</I>
folder inside the destination folder which itself is, by default, the
<I>Contents</I> subfolder of the bundle. For instance:
<PRE>
    #pragma localize_directory "Local/Strings/"
</PRE>
will cause the localized strings files to be written in some 
<I>MyApp.app/Contents/Local/Strings/&lt;language&gt;.lproj</I> folder 
(depending on the chosen language) instead of 
<I>MyApp.app/Contents/Resources/&lt;language&gt;.lproj</I>.<P><H4><A NAME="M33"></A>The 'output_eol' pragma</H4>
The <I>output_eol</I> pragma lets you specify another type of line endings
for the output files. The possible values are <I>cr</I> for Mac, 
<I>lf</I> for Unix and <I>crlf</I> for Windows. This pragma is useful to
override a setting made with the <I>-output_eol</I> option on the command
line of the <B>plcompile</B> shell script.
<PRE>
    #pragma output_eol lf
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M34"></A>The 'output_encoding' pragma</H4>
The <I>output_eol</I> pragma lets you specify another encoding
for the output files. The possible values are listed when you execute the 
command:
<PRE>
    plcompile -help
</PRE><P>You would normally be interested only in the utf-8 and utf-16 encodings 
which are the only encodings recognized for the property list files. <B>PList 
Compiler</B> is able though to handle all the other encodings.<P>This pragma is useful to override a setting made with the 
<I>-output_encoding</I> option on the command line of the <B>plcompile</B>
shell script. For instance:
<PRE>
    #pragma output_encoding utf-16
</PRE><P><H4><A NAME="M35"></A>The 'plist_version' pragma</H4>
The <I>plist_version</I> pragma lets you specify another version of the 
property list format. Possible values currently are 0.9 and 1.0. This is 
the value written in the <I>version</I> attribute of the &lt;plist&gt; tag in the 
<I>.plist</I> files. For instance:
<PRE>
    #pragma plist_version 0_9
</PRE>
yields
<PRE>
    <plist version="0_9">
</PRE>
This is the same value stored in the <TT>__PLIST__</TT> predefined variable
(see below).<P><H2><A NAME="M36"></A>Substitutable variables</H2><P>Substitutable variables are variables whose value is inserted when the 
script is run. These variables can be defined with a #define preprocessor 
macro or in the shell environment. There are also some useful predefined 
variables.<P>To invoke variables defined in the shell environment (in particular all 
the variables abvailable in an XCode project), you must surround them with 
double underscores. For instance (see the XCode documentation for a 
complete list):
__BUILD_ROOT__,
__CACHE_ROOT__,
__DEBUGGING_SYMBOLS__,
__EXECUTABLE_PATH__,
__WARNING_LDFLAGS__,
__ZERO_LINK__, etc.<P>Variables defined with a <I>#define</I> macro can be invoked directly 
(without the double underscores). For 
instance, if you define
<PRE>
    #define kBundleShortVersion "1.2.3"
</PRE>
you can then have a key in the <I>plist</I> dictionary declared like this
<PRE>
    key "CFBundleVersion" value string kBundleShortVersion
</PRE><P>For variables which can be set at different levels, the order of precedence
is the following: an option set by a <I>#define</I> directive or modified
by a <I>#pragma</I> directive in the plc source file overrides any option
set on the command line which, in turn, overrides an option set by a shell
environment variable.<P><H3><A NAME="M37"></A>Predefined variables</H3><P>A few predefined variables are set each time the <B>plcompile</B> script is 
run. <P>The five following variables existed in the CodeWarrior property list
compiler. They are still available with <B>PList Compiler</B> in order to
ensure some compatibility with already existing plc files (and because they
are very useful!):
<DL><P><DT><B>__FILE__</B><DL><DT>
This variable always contains the name of the file currently processed. If
another file is included with an <I>#include</I> preprocessor macro, the
value of the variable is changed accordingly so that it always designates
the file being processed.</DL><P><DT><B>__OUTPUT_CREATOR__</B><DL><DT>
This variable contains the creator
type of the built product. It corresponds to the MACOS_CREATOR XCode variable.</DL><P><DT><B>__OUTPUT_TYPE__</B><DL><DT>
This variable contains the file
type of the built product. It corresponds to the MACOS_TYPE XCode variable.</DL><P><DT><B>__OUTPUT_FILENAME__</B><DL><DT>
This variable contains the name of the built product. It is equivalent to 
the concatenation of the PRODUCT_NAME and
WRAPPER_EXTENSION XCode variables.</DL><P><DT><B>__DATE__</B><DL><DT>
This is the complete date at the moment where the script is executed. it is
returned in the format specified by the ISO 8601 standard:
YY-MM-DDTHH:MM:SSZ. For instance <I>"2005-10-04T17:12:23Z"</I>.</DL>
</DL><P><B>PList Compiler</B> introduces other useful predefined variables: 
<DL><P><DT><B>__YEAR__</B><DL><DT>
The current year (four digits)</DL><P><DT><B>__MONTH__</B><DL><DT>
The current month number (01 - 12)</DL><P><DT><B>__MONTHNAME__</B><DL><DT>
The full month name (January, etc.)</DL><P><DT><B>__DAY__</B><DL><DT>
The current day of month (01 - 31)</DL><P><DT><B>__DAYNAME__</B><DL><DT>
The full day name (Monday, etc.)</DL><P><DT><B>__SHORTDATE__</B><DL><DT>
The current date ass YYYY-MM-DD.</DL><P><DT><B>__TIME__</B><DL><DT>
The current time as HH:MM::SS.</DL><P><DT><B>__HOURS__</B><DL><DT>
The hours part of the TIME string.</DL><P><DT><B>__MINUTES__</B><DL><DT>
The minutes part of the TIME string.</DL><P><DT><B>__SECONDS__</B><DL><DT>
The seconds part of the TIME string.</DL>
</DL><P>For instance:
<PRE>
    __DATE__      = 2005-10-04T15:54:36Z
    __SHORTDATE__ = 2005-10-04
    __YEAR__      = 2005
    __MONTH__     = 10
    __MONTHNAME__ = October
    __DAY__       = 04
    __DAYNAME__   = Tuesday
    __TIME__      = 15:54:36
    __HOURS__     = 15
    __MINUTES__   = 54
    __SECONDS__   = 36
</PRE><P><H3><A NAME="M38"></A>XCode environment variables</H3><P>All the environment variables set by an XCode project are accessible with 
<B>PList Compiler</B>. The syntax is the same as for the predefined variables: 
the name of the environment variable must be surrounded by double 
underscores. For instance, if you wan to invoke the value of the 
INFOPLIST_PATH variable in an XCode project, you would write it as __INFOPLIST_PATH__
in the plc file. For instance
<PRE>
    key "InfoPlistPath" value string __INFOPLIST_PATH__
</PRE><P>Some of these variables are set by XCode itself (they are generally meant
to be read-only variables) while the others can be set in the info window
or a particular target. The name of a variable corresponding to a
particular setting is always indicated by XCode between parentheses in the
help text displayed when you select this setting in a Target Info window.<P><H3><A NAME="M39"></A>Unsupported variables</H3><P>A few predefined variables available in the CodeWarrior property list 
compiler are not supported by <B>PList Compiler</B>. This is mainly because they 
are specific to the CodeWarrior IDE and have no meaning with XCode. Here 
is the list of these variables:
<PRE>
    __APPLEMACHLINKER__, __MACH__, __MERGELINKER__, 
    __MWMACHLINKER__, __MWPEFLINKER__
</PRE><P>The <TT>__LINE__</TT> variable is not supported either, as well as the 
<TT>__IDE_TARGET__()</TT> and <TT>__STRING__()</TT> pseudo-macros.<P><H2><A NAME="M40"></A>Download</H2><P><H2><A NAME="M41"></A>Known problems</H2><P><H2><A NAME="M42"></A>Version history</H2><P><UL>
